## EEG connectivity
‘Connectivity’ in EEG (hereafter referred to as ‘EEG-connectivity’) involves the
consideration of the relationship between two or more EEG signals (Cohen, 2014; Michel,
2009). In this way, EEG is a tool through which connectivity within the brain can be assessed
either in time, frequency, or time-frequency domains.


## EEG coherence
EEG coherence may yield information about network formation and functional integration across brain regions. 
The coherence measure is generally distinct from synchrony (Singer, 1999), 
which in the neuroscience literature normally refers to signals oscillating at the same frequency with identical phases.

EEG-coherence analysis is designed to find out whether the brain waves from two different parts of the brain are synchronized. 
Synchronization means that the crests and throughs of the waves occur simultaneously as shown in the left part of the illustration below.
