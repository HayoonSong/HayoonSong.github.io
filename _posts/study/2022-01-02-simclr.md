# Contrastive learning

> Contrastive learning is a machine learning technique used to learn the **general features** of a dataset **without labels** by teaching the model which data points are similar or different.   
Contrastive learning은 레이블 정보를 사용하지 않는 **비지도 학습**으로 데이터의 **일반적인 특징(general features)**을 학습하기 위해 사용된다.  

예를 들어,

# Overview

* Data augmentation module
    - Random cropping and resize to original
    - Random color distortions (jitter or drop)
    - Random Gaussian blur

* Base encoder (Unsupervised pretraining)
    - ResNet-50
    
* Projection head
* Contrastive loss function
